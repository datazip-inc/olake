## üîê Testing SSH Tunnel Support (Oracle & MongoDB)

OLake drivers for **Oracle** and **MongoDB** now support SSH tunneling via a local port-forwarded connection.

To test this feature:

1. Generate a dummy PEM key:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f test_key.pem -N ""

   ```

2. Place the key in the appropriate driver folder:
   drivers/oracle/internal/test_key.pem
   drivers/mongodb/internal/test_key.pem

3. Run the tests:
   go test -v -run TestOracleSSHConnection
   go test -v -run TestMongoSSHConnection

These tests are designed to fail gracefully if no SSH server is running on localhost:2222, but they validate:

- SSH key parsing
- Tunnel setup logic
- DSN override behavior

This ensures contributors can safely test SSH logic without needing a real bastion.
