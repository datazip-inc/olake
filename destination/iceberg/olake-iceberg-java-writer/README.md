# Java Iceberg Sink

This project is a fork and modified version of the [debezium-server-iceberg](https://github.com/memiiso/debezium-server-iceberg) project, originally used to dump data from Debezium Server into Iceberg. The modifications make it compatible with Olake by sending data in Debezium format.

## Architecture

The data flow in this project is as follows:


Golang Code  --gRPC-->  Java (This Project)  --Write to Iceberg-->  S3 + Iceberg Catalog

(Check out the Olake Iceberg Writer code to understand how data is sent to Java via gRPC.)
